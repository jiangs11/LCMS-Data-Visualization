# Liquid Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry

Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data is typically very large in size and often difficult and time-consuming to interpret. This project focuses on metabolomics data collected by the mass spectrometers. We used Mayavi, a application and library for interactive scientific data visualization and 3D plotting in Python. Unlike Matplotlib, Mayavi is capable of handling data of large size.
